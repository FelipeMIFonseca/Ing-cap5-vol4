                        <p class="general-text">
                          We live in a consumerist society in which it has become quite common to keep buying stuff out of impulse. In most households across the globe it is possible to step on kid&#8217;s toys occupying more space than necessary, books piling up, and an overwhelming quantity of clothes and house appliances. But do we need all of that? Better yet, will we ever have time to make use of all the things we feel the urge to buy? What is it that drives us to keep on purchasing things that we don&#8217;t need?
                        </p>
                        <p class="general-text">
                          Some might argue that we buy &#8211; particularly when it is an impulse purchase &#8211; because we get a dopamine rush. It is like the act of shopping activates pleasure-related areas in our brains. Other possible reasons that explain our tendency to succumb to the temptation of buying are related to anxiety, unhappiness, need of control, to name a few. Whatever the cause of this behavior might be, getting a better understanding of this phenomenon and reach for solutions has become one of the biggest contemporary man&#8217;s concerns.

                          <p class="quote-source">By Will deHoo</p>
                          <p class="general-text"><b>Ever seen this?</b>
                             A kid in a grocery store randomly grabs an item from a low shelf for a parent to buy. The parent, without thinking, adds it to the cart. <br>
                            <b>Or ever done this?</b>
        Realized you&#8217;ve bought something in the past that you never use, or really didn&#8217;t need. <br>
        <b>Ever felt this?</b>
        Had regret over something you&#8217;ve bought. <br>
        <b>Or felt this?</b>
         Stressed when a bill arrives. <br>
        From the day you were born, you have been surrounded by a marketing environment that is based on persuading you to spend money without planning &#8212; the definition of impulse buying. <br>
        If you think about it, isn&#8217;t the goal of virtually all marketing to get you to make an impulse buy? [...] In the air. Impulse buying messages &#8212; like the air we breathe &#8212; are omnipresent and accepted by us without thinking. <br>
        If you are an &#8220;average&#8221; consumer: <br>
        &#8226;	At least 40% of all the money you spend in your entire lifetime will be on &#8220;Impulse buys&#8221;. <br>
        &#8226;	You&#8217;ll buy something you don&#8217;t need, pay more than you need or buy something that can actually hurt you. [&#8230;] <br>
        <b>Why do we fall for this?</b>
         Because impulse buys are thoughtless and effortless decisions. They don&#8217;t require brain power. <br>
        But learning to break the impulse-buying habit actually takes work! Marketers know it takes work, too. They know that if you&#8217;re faced with enough impulse decisions, you&#8217;ll eventually become fatigued. Bingo! You make a lot more impulse buys.  <br>
        <b>How do we stop bad impulse buys? </b>
        You can retrain your brain. And in retraining your brain, you will influence the shopping habits of all people who regularly shop with you. <br>
        Start with a reality check. <br>
        &#8226;	Take an &#8220;impulse-buying inventory&#8221; of your home. Did you find anything you bought but haven&#8217;t used or don&#8217;t really need? <br>
        &#8226;	Think about your last visit to a store. Any store. Ask yourself this question about each item you bought: &#8220;Did I go into the store planning to buy that item?&#8221;   <br>
        Keep your mind on a bigger goal than the impulse to buy. Life isn&#8217;t fun if you&#8217;re always telling yourself, &#8220;Don&#8217;t buy that!&#8221;. But if you look at impulse buying moments as chances to help you reach a bigger goal in your life, you&#8217;re taking positive action. For example, thinking: &#8220;Hey. If I don&#8217;t spend that twenty, my savings account can grow.&#8221; Or &#8220;If I skip that purchase, the vacation gets closer.&#8221; <br>
        Adopt core habits: [...] Always make a shopping list. Once you write down the items it will help to clarify what is really necessary and what is just impulse buying. Use the motto &#8220;if it isn&#8217;t on the list, question it!&#8221;, it will develop the habit of thoughtfull spending. <br>
        &#8226;	Develop the shopping lists for more than groceries: Clothes. Housing items. Vacation goals. Major purchases like cars, homes and education. <br>
        &#8226;	Expect marketing tricks. Have you ever bought a &#8220;jumbo&#8221; size of an item because you assumed it was cheaper in volume? Did you know that many times it isn&#8217;t cheaper? <br>
        &#8226;	Budget money for impulse buys. Skipping all impulse buys is boring and self-defeating. Set a small &#8220;play&#8221; budget for you&#8230;  
        Every impulse buy has long-term consequences. Modifying even half of those buys can change your life financially. <br>

                      <p class="quote-source">Peter Sells Sierra Gonzales</p>

                      <div class="flex-exercicios">
                        <p class="general-text">
                          Not all advertisements make perfect sense. Not all of them promote or imply acceptance of social values that everyone would agree are what we should hope for, in an enlightened and civilized society. Some advertisements appear to degrade our images of ourselves, our language, and appear to move the emphasis of interaction in our society to (even more) consumerism. There may even be a dark, seamy, or seedy side to advertising. This is hardly surprising, as our society is indeed a consumer society, and it is highly capitalistic in the simplest sense. There is no doubt that advertising promotes a consumer culture, and helps create and perpetuate the ideology that creates the apparent need for the products it markets. <br>
                          For our purposes here, none of this matters. Our task is to analyze advertisements, and to see if we can understand how they do what they do. We will leave the task of how we interpret our findings in the larger social, moral and cultural contexts for another occasion. <br>
                          It is often said that advertising is irrational, and, again, that may well be true. But this is where the crossover between information and persuasion becomes important; an advertisement does not have to be factually informative (but it cannot be factually misleading). <br>
                          In a discussion of what kind of benefit an advertisement might offer to a consumer, Jim Aitchison (1999) provides the following quote from Gary Goldsmith of Lowe &amp; Partners, New York. It sums up perfectly what it is that one should look for in an advertisement. The question posed is &#8220;Is advertising more powerful if it offers a rational benefit?&#8221; Here is Goldsmith&#8217;s answer: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need to offer a rational benefit. I think you need to offer a benefit that a rational person can understand.&#8221;

                          Not long ago,
                          <b>Brazil&#8217;s real-estate market</b>
                          was one of the biggest symbols of the
                          <b>country&#8217;s burgeoning economic might.</b>
                          Now, it&#8217;s fallen victim to an ever-deepening recession. <br>
                          PDG Realty SA, once the largest homebuilder by revenue, hired Rothschild last week to help restructure 5.8 billion reais ($1.6 billion) of debt after second-quarter net sales sank 88 percent. Earlier this month, Rossi Residencial SA, which has 2.5 billion reais in debt, also brought in advisers to &#8220;restructure operations and review strategies.&#8221; Since 2010, the builder has lost 99 percent of its stock-market value.  <br>
                          The real-estate industry, which is equal to about 10 percent of
        <b>Brazil&#8217;s economy</b>
        , is emerging as one of the latest casualties of a recession that analysts forecast will be its longest since the
        <b>1930s</b>
        . To make matters worse, interest rates are the highest in almost a decade while inflation is soaring. &#8220;There is no real estate company that survives without sales,&#8221; Bruno Mendonça Lima de Carvalho, the head of fixed income at Guide Investimentos SA, said from Sao Paulo. &#8220;You can&#8217;t import or export apartments. You&#8217;re relying solely on domestic activity.&#8221; <br>
        PDG tried to boost revenue by lowering prices, financing up to 20 percent of some home purchases and even offering to buy back apartments if banks deny financing. Still, it sold just 217 units in the second quarter on a net basis, compared with 1749 in 2014.

                          On Friday, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut PDG&#8217;s rating three levels to Caa3, citing the possibility of significant losses for bondholders and other lenders. Secured creditors may recover less than 80 percent in a default, according to Moody&#8217;s, which kept a negative outlook on the rating. &#8220;The company is facing additional liquidity pressures from a prolonged deterioration in industry dynamics, including weak sales speed, tight financing availability and declining real estate prices,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said. <br>
                          Sao Paulo-based Rossi said in an e-mailed response to questions that second quarter sales improved and that the company&#8217;s main focus is to reduce debt. Gross debt fell about 30 percent in the 12 months ended in June, Rossi said. <br>
                          Home sales in Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy tumbled 14 percent in the first half of 2015, according to data from the national real estate institute. Builders cut new projects by 20 percent during that span, while available financing shrank by about a quarter. <br>

                          That&#8217;s a reversal from just two years ago, when real-estate prices in places like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo had surged as much as 230 percent as rising incomes, a soaring real and record-low borrowing costs ignited a wave of home buying. <br>
                          Brazilians find themselves in drastically different circumstances today. The currency fell 0.4 percent Wednesday as of 3:25 p.m. in New York, extending its loss this year to 26 percent. The jobless rate climbed to a five-year high of 7.5 percent last month. <br>
                          The central bank boosted its key rate to 14.25 percent in July, making it ever more expensive to finance the purchase of a home. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of demand, and demand is really weak,&#8221; Will Landers, who manages Latin American stocks at BlackRock, said from Princeton, New Jersey. &#8220;We may have reached a peak in interest rates, but they should continue to be at these levels for a while. Consumers will stay on the sidelines because debt levels are still high, and employment will get worse.&#8221;

                      </div>
                      <div class="general-text">
                        <p class="general-text">Everyone has at least one best friend, some maybe even more. There are also those people who are just friends and also arch-enemies. People may think that just because they are your friends it means that they are your best friend. The thing is, even though they are your friend, the relationship between a best friend and a friend is different. [...]  <br>
                          Arch-enemies often know more about each other than two friends. In a comparison of personal relationships, friendship is considered to be closer than association, although a wide range of degrees of intimacy exists in friendships, arch-enemies, and associations. [...] The study of friendship is included in the fields of sociology, social psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and zoology. Even animals have familiars! Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, among which are social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. In Russia, one typically bestows very few people the status of &#8220;friend&#8221;. <br>
                          These friendships, however, make up in intensity what they lack in number. Friends are entitled to call each other by their first names alone, and to use diminutives. A customary example of polite behavior is addressing &#8220;acquaintances&#8221; by full first name plus their patronymic. These could include relationships which elsewhere would be qualified as real friendships, such as workplace relationships of long standing, or neighbors with whom one shares an occasional meal or a social drink with. <br>
                          Also in the Middle East and Central Asia, male friendships, while less restricted than in Russia, tend to be reserved and respectable in nature. They may use nicknames and diminutive forms of their first names. In countries like India, it is believed in some parts that friendship is a form of respect, not born out of fear or superiority. Friends are people who are equal in most standards, but still respect each other regardless of their attributes or shortcomings. [...]  <br>
                          According to a study documented in the June 2006 issue of the Journal American Sociological Review, Americans are thought to be suffering a loss in the quality and quantity of close friendships since at least 1985. The study&#8217;s results state that twenty-five percent of Americans have no close confidants, and the average total number of confidants per citizen has dropped from four to two. According to the study, Americans&#8217; dependence on family as a safety net went up from fifty-seven percent to eighty percent; Americans dependence on a partner or spouse went up from five percent to nine percent.  <br>

                        <p class="general-text">
                          Bullying among children and teenagers is not something new but it is getting more and more common by modern methods of communication. <br>
                          Cyberbullying happens when an adolescent is put in danger by another child or teenager by photos or text messages sent to cell phones or posted on social networks. Sometimes cyberbullies send mails with sexual comments or take passwords of other teenagers and log on to websites with false identities. Children also play Internet games and make fun of each other in many ways. <br>
                          A study by a Canadian University shows that half of the young people interviewed said that they suffer bullying. One of the reasons is the great use of cell phones over the past years. Today&#8217;s children are connected with each other electronically. They call friends every time they want or communicate with them on Facebook. <br>
                          Cyberbullying is getting extremely popular because teens can stay anonymous. Many adolescents act this way because they feel frustrated or angry and want to punish somebody for something that happened to them. At other times they do it just for fun or because have nothing else to do. Parents usually don&#8217;t know their child is a cyberbully. They perceive it just when the victim or the victim&#8217;s parents contact them. <br>
                          This kind of bullying is not as inoffensive as many people think. In some cases it can lead to suicide. Many countries have organized campaigns to inform adults and children of its dangers.

                        <p class="general-text">
                          <b>The death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the public&#8217;s response to it, shook the House of Windsor.  </b> <br>
                          Twenty years on, there&#8217;s been a coup at the palace. It was bloodless. All the royals remain standing. But the power has shifted. <br>
                          The departure, earlier this month, of the Queen&#8217;s dedicated senior official Sir Christopher Geidt has meant her eldest son can exert more control over the monarchy&#8217;s direction of travel. <br>
                          The comings and goings of courtiers excite those on the inside and leave outsiders cold. <br>
                          However, recent changes should cheer Prince Charles. The heir who&#8217;s waited and waited is more content and less anguished. <br>
                          He&#8217;s still driven by a desire to deliver change but the royal prophet in the wilderness on climate change has been embraced by the mainstream.  <br>
                          A prince once derided for talking to plants is praised for trying to save the planet. <br>
                          With each year that passes, his mother will do less and he will do more. <br>
                          There are fewer clouds on his horizon. It&#8217;s a horizon that was once obscured by the War of the Waleses: his televised admission of adultery, and his leaked comments about tampons.

                          And yet, and yet. Whatever accommodation he reached with his first wife in life hasn&#8217;t survived her death. Diana haunts Charles. <br>
                          A recent YouGov poll commissioned by the Press Association suggested that the number of people who believe the Prince of Wales has made a positive contribution to the Royal Family has fallen over the past four years, down from 60% to 36%. <br>
                          This polling took place at a time when it was hard to escape references to Charles&#8217;s painful past.  <br>
                          Newspapers and television channels have reflected at length on the influence of Diana, Princess of Wales, an influence that stretched from fashion to the British monarchy. <br>
                          It&#8217;s been a month of coverage that must have perplexed anyone under the age of 25 and would have confused a visiting Martian. <br>
                          Charles&#8217;s many supporters will argue that Diana&#8217;s adverse impact on his popularity will recede with each passing year. But 20 years on, her influence still registers. (...)
